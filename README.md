Windows games on Raspberry Pi 4 with box86 / wine

With Box86 and wine-i386 it's possible to play many games on an ARM device such as the Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4).

Not all games do work well with wine, however. Some games need specific external DLLs installed via Winetricks. Some games need a specific wine version. Even special wrappers or patches are needed to get a game working.

This repository is about collecting and informing about the different approaches of getting games to run with box86/wine on a Rpi4. All information about different approaches will be collected in the Wiki.
